# 1. Project organization

access config from a single place, propagate it using only function or constructor arguments
Single error handler
log result in a single place, or very few places, at most high level as possibleÂº
Don't log errors, throw them and catch them in caller function

use object destructuring from parameters
standar error responses
bunyan as logger

use allways promises instead of callbacks, or use promisify

empty functions, ignoring errbacks -> use promises
split logic from interface (express, fastify)

Don't define classes as object containers, there's no types. Use directly objects

early error exit (return, throw, continue, break...)

return-else
Promises inside Promise handler
Object desctructuring and structuring

Files that export a class by default, named with the class name (including capital letter)

Don't merge promises and callbacks

      if (HNres.error && HNres.error === true)

Don't return objects with an error field, throw errors or reject promises

Inversed signature of errbacks (error must be first argument)

Don't use objects with error field, use correct http statuses
