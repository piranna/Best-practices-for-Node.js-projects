# 1. Project organization

## Data flow

access config from a single place, propagate it using only function or constructor arguments
- [ ] Get config globally, not for each request (performance)

- [ ] Direct access to routes, instead of exporting them from `routes/index.js`

## Logic flow

use allways promises instead of callbacks, or use promisify
empty functions, ignoring errbacks -> use promises
Don't merge promises and callbacks

early error exit (return, throw, continue, break...)
- [ ] Use "early return" design for errors instead of an `else` branch

## Errors handling

Single error handler
Don't log errors, throw them and catch them in caller function

Don't return objects with an error field, throw errors or reject promises
Don't use objects with error field, use correct http statuses

- [ ] Capturing `404` errors and forwarding to error handler, this is the same
      as `express` default behaviour, remove it
- [ ] Use requests handlers `next` callback to pass errors to central errors
      handler instead of manage errors in each case by hand
- [ ] Callback `error` argument must not be ignored

## Logging

log result in a single place, or very few places, at most high level as possible
bunyan as logger

## Code architecture

split logic from interface (express, fastify)
- [ ] Application logic directly on routes handlers, abstract it to a core class

standard error responses
- [ ] Use correct HTTP error status for the returned errors
- [ ] There's no need to use HTML templates for a pure API server receiving and
      sending JSON objects, remove them

## Code style

Don't use Node.js modules as singletons

use object destructuring from parameters
Object desctructuring and structuring
- [ ] Use object destructuring to get the request object attributes

- [ ] Lines not limited to standard 80 columns
- [ ] Files don't end with a new line (Node.js standard)
- [ ] not using standard two-spaces tabs
- [ ] not using `index.js` files to define main entry of directory-based modules
- [ ] Using CommonJS modules instead of ES6 modules
- [ ] Code indentation is not uniform in the code
- [ ] Mixed single and double quoted strings, use only single ones
- [ ] 'use strict' is not needed in Node.js modules, they already are executed
      in strict mode
- [ ] `require()`s are not in correct order (built-is > dependencies > local)
- [ ] object attributes are not in alphabetical order
- [ ] `App.listen()` method already returns a `HttpServer` instance, there's no
      need to use explicitly the Node.js `http` built-in module
- [ ] Use `const` for `require()`d dependencies and constant values
- [ ] There's no need to create a class if there's no state, replace by a
      namespace object
- [ ] Using useless arrow functions to define routes handlers, use regular
      functions instead
- [ ] Don't use useless arrow functions to define the tests and test suites

## Code patterns

- [ ] Use strings templates
- [ ] Don't generate query string and URL by hand, use `URL` built-in module
- [ ] Use functional methods (filter, map, reduce...) to initialize and fill
      arrays instead of doing it by hand
- [ ] Return `Promise` objects in methods instead of using callbacks
- [ ] Don't create client objects on each method call, do it in the constructor
- [ ] Use common `onScan()` function
- [ ] Unify code at `resolveKeys()` for both when `item` is array or not
- [ ] Convert to namespace

cluster

### Code smells

Don't define classes as object containers, there's no types. Use directly objects
- [ ] Models doesn't have code, is it needed?

return-else
Promises inside Promise handler

      if (HNres.error && HNres.error === true)

- [ ] `request` module to do HTTP requests is big and bloated, use smaller `got`
      or directly the Node.js `http` module
https://github.com/request/request/issues/3142
https://github.com/request/request/issues/3143

- [ ] Use `Promise` objects instead of callbacks
- [ ] Extra parenthesis and hardcoded magic strings in condition
- [ ] Empty useless constructor, remove
- [ ] Set `faqCategories` object as private static class attribute
- [ ] Convert `FaqResponseBuilder` in a namespace
- [ ] Set `translations` as instance private attribute, not module global
- [ ] Convert to namespace and create S3 client at module level
- [ ] Don't include the `.json` substring as part of the translation keys, use
      ISO codes instead of filenames
- [ ] Use `Promise`s inside a promise resolver is an anti-pattern and
      code-smell, move conditional out of promise resolver and return the
      `Promise` object directly
