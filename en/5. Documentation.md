# 4. Documentation

> **TL;DR**
>
> - Always write documentation in english.
> - Use a standard format. In case of doubt, Markdown is easy to read and write.

- [ ] `README.md` file info is useless, should explain purposse of the project
      and how to install and use it

specs a priori, docs a posteriori (full circle)

You should **never** mix original sources with generated files nor upload it
to the git repository, but an exception can be done with documentation. This
should always be available for reference, and also thanks to Github Pages
feature of being able to publish your repo `docs/` folder, also for private
projects, you can have this way your docs online by free. The best way to
include the API documentation in your project docs is by using a git hook
that will generate the docs, store them inside the `docs/` folder in an
easily known place, and add the generated files each time a commit is done.
This way, the documentation gets to be updated all the time mirroring the
actual code state.
