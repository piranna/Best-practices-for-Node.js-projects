> **TL;DR**
>
> - Follow standards and conventions before creating yours.
> - Make it simple, not simpler. It's not simple enough when there are things
    that can be removed or factored out to other upper or smaller modules. Stop
    when it's so simple that it starts to not being useful.
> - Follow YAGNI, KISS and DRY principles, ideally in that exact order.

> - First make it works, later optimize it. (Francisco J. Ballesteros "Nemo")
