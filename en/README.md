If I would need to reduce the topics discussed on this book to just only four of
them, they would be

> **TL;DR**
>
> 1. Follow standards and conventions before creating yours.
> 2. Make it simple, not simpler. It's not simple enough when there are things
     that can be removed or factored out to other upper or smaller modules. Stop
     when it's so simple it starts to don't be useful.
> 3. Follow YAGNI, KISS and DRY principles, ideally in that exact order.
> 4. Automate as much as possible.

but if I would need to do it to a single statement, that would be

> **TL;DR**
>
> - First make it works, later optimize it. (Francisco J. Ballesteros "Nemo")

just only, I would add "please don't forget the 'later optimize it' part" ;-)
