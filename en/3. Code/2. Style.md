# 2. Code style

`.eslintignore`: not an usual one, but sometimes useful. Define files to be
ignored when running the `eslint` linter tool, it's good to ignore coverage
report files and documentation helper files.

```sh
# Does .eslintignore file exists?
test -f .eslintignore

# Has .eslintignore file all needed patterns?
grep -l -q -v -w 'bower_modules|coverage|node_modules|vendor|*.bkp|*.tmp' \
.eslintignore
```

> **TL;DR**
>
> - Use a linter and code style. Whatever you want, also your own, but use one.

Code linting checks (and sometimes fix) your code style, making it uniform and
homogeneous. This makes it easier to read but also allow to detect some pitfalls
like undeclared variables or garbage (unused) code and variables.

One of the most popular linter is [eslint](https://eslint.org/). It's very
configurable and already provide some recomended style rules that can be used as
basis, but you can use any other recomended style rules
([AirBnB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) is very popular).
If you don't want to think about style, [standard JS](https://standardjs.com/)
and [semistandard](https://github.com/standard/semistandard) if you don't want
to use semicolons after each statement are two config-less options.

```sh
# Has linter?
npm -c "require('package.json').scripts.lint != null"
```

Don't use Node.js modules as singletons

use object destructuring from parameters
Object desctructuring and structuring
- [ ] Use object destructuring to get the request object attributes

- [ ] Lines not limited to standard 80 columns
- [ ] Files don't end with a new line (Node.js standard)
- [ ] not using standard two-spaces tabs
- [ ] not using `index.js` files to define main entry of directory-based modules
- [ ] Using CommonJS modules instead of ES6 modules
- [ ] Code indentation is not uniform in the code
- [ ] Mixed single and double quoted strings, use only single ones
- [ ] 'use strict' is not needed in Node.js modules, they already are executed
      in strict mode
- [ ] `require()`s are not in correct order (built-is > dependencies > local)
- [ ] object attributes are not in alphabetical order
- [ ] `App.listen()` method already returns a `HttpServer` instance, there's no
      need to use explicitly the Node.js `http` built-in module
- [ ] Use `const` for `require()`d dependencies and constant values
- [ ] There's no need to create a class if there's no state, replace by a
      namespace object
- [ ] Using useless arrow functions to define routes handlers, use regular
      functions instead
- [ ] Don't use useless arrow functions to define the tests and test suites

## Code patterns

- [ ] Use strings templates
- [ ] Don't generate query string and URL by hand, use `URL` built-in module
- [ ] Use functional methods (filter, map, reduce...) to initialize and fill
      arrays instead of doing it by hand
- [ ] Return `Promise` objects in methods instead of using callbacks
- [ ] Don't create client objects on each method call, do it in the constructor
- [ ] Use common `onScan()` function
- [ ] Unify code at `resolveKeys()` for both when `item` is array or not
- [ ] Convert to namespace

cluster

### Code smells

Don't define classes as object containers, there's no types. Use directly objects
- [ ] Models doesn't have code, is it needed?

return-else
Promises inside Promise handler

      if (HNres.error && HNres.error === true)

- [ ] `request` module to do HTTP requests is big and bloated, use smaller `got`
      or directly the Node.js `http` module
https://github.com/request/request/issues/3142
https://github.com/request/request/issues/3143

- [ ] Extra parenthesis and hardcoded magic strings in condition
- [ ] Empty useless constructor, remove
- [ ] Set `faqCategories` object as private static class attribute
- [ ] Convert `FaqResponseBuilder` in a namespace
- [ ] Set `translations` as instance private attribute, not module global
- [ ] Convert to namespace and create S3 client at module level
- [ ] Don't include the `.json` substring as part of the translation keys, use
      ISO codes instead of filenames
- [ ] Use `Promise`s inside a promise resolver is an anti-pattern and
      code-smell, move conditional out of promise resolver and return the
      `Promise` object directly
